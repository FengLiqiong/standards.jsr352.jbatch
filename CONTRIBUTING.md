## Contributor License Agreement

### One CLA applies to all three repositories: SPEC, RI, TCK

Note that for your convenience we provide one CLA document below which applies to all three separate repositories.

* [SPEC](https://github.com/WASdev/standards.jsr352.batch-spec)
* [RI](https://github.com/WASdev/standards.jsr352.jbatch)
* [TCK](https://github.com/WASdev/standards.jsr352.tck)


### Why is there a CLA?

In order for us to accept pull requests, the contributor must first complete
a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This clarifies the intellectual 
property license granted with any contribution. It is for your protection as a 
Contributor as well as the protection of IBM and its customers; it does not 
change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You can download the CLAs here:

If you are an IBMer, please contact us directly as the contribution process is
slightly different.
